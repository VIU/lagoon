<p class="note info">If you are deploying a Drupal Project, skip this and read the <a href="../drupal/first-deployment-of-drupal.md">Drupal-specific first deployment documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="1-make-sure-you-are-ready">1. Make sure you are ready</h2>

<p>In order to make your first deployment a successful one, please make sure that your project is Lagoonized and that you have set up the project in Lagoon. If not, or youâ€™re not sure, or that doesnâ€™t sound familiar, donâ€™t worry, go back and follow the <a href="setup_project.md">Step-by-Step Guides</a> which show you how this works, and then come back and deploy!</p>

<h2 id="2-push">2. Push</h2>

<p>With Lagoon, you create a new deployment by pushing into a branch that is configured to be deployed.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t have any new code to push, donâ€™t worry! Run:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git commit <span class="nt">--allow-empty</span> <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"go, go! Power Rangers!"</span>
git push
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will trigger a push, and your Git hosting will inform Lagoon about this push via the configured webhook.</p>

<p>If all is correct, you should see a notification in your configured chat system (this has been configured by your friendly Lagoon administrator):</p>

<p><img src="../.gitbook/assets/first_deployment_slack_start%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%283%29.jpg" alt="Slack notification that a push has been made in a Lagoonized repository." /></p>

<p>This informs you that Lagoon has just started to deploy your code. Depending on the size of the code and amount of containers, this will take a couple of seconds. Just relax. If you want to know whatâ€™s happening now, check out the <a href="build-and-deploy-process.md">Build and Deploy Process of Lagoon</a>.</p>

<p>You can also check your Lagoon UI to see the progress of any deployment (your Lagoon administrator has the info).</p>

<h2 id="3-its-done">3. Itâ€™s done</h2>

<p>As soon as Lagoon is done building and deploying it will send a second notification to the chat system, here an example:</p>

<p><img src="../.gitbook/assets/first_deployment_slack_2nd_success.jpg" alt="Slack notification of a successful Lagoon build and deployment." /></p>

<p>It tells you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which project has been deployed.</li>
  <li>Which branch and Git SHA have been deployed.</li>
  <li>A link to the full logs of the build and deployment.</li>
  <li>Links to all routes (URLs) where the environment can be reached.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also quickly tell what kind of notification it is by the emoji at the beginning - whether itâ€™s just info that the build has started, a success, or fail.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s it! We hope that wasnâ€™t too hard - making devOps accessible is what we are striving for!</p>

<h2 id="but-wait-how-about-other-branches-or-the-production-environment">But wait, how about other branches or the production environment?</h2>

<p>Thatâ€™s the beauty of Lagoon: itâ€™s exactly the same! Just push the name of the branch and that one will be deployed.</p>

<h2 id="failure-dont-worry">Failure? Donâ€™t worry</h2>

<p>Did the deployment fail? Oh no! But weâ€™re here to help:</p>
