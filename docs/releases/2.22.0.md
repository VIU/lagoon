## Release Notes

This release is a standard Lagoon release. There are changes required for teams managing their own Lagoon installations (core and remote).

## Upgrades

Self-managed Lagoon installs will need to be aware of three changes in lagoon-core and lagoon-remote
* https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-charts/pull/602 updates the version of NATS, which requires a couple of straightforward config structure changes in lagoon-core and lagoon-remote. THere are no changes to the certs  or keys, just the naming of the YAML items
* https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-charts/pull/688 introduces a new version of the lagoon build and task CRDs - after installing lagoon-remote, you will need to apply the new CRDs for builds and tasks to work - e.g. `helm show crds lagoon/lagoon-build-deploy --version 0.30.2 | kubectl apply -f -`
* https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon-charts/pull/687 converted the docker-host to a StatefulSet - which allows for multiple replicas to be specified - this will provide some load-balancing of docker workloads. It will result in a new docker-host cache being created the first time any replica starts up (including on the first deployment) - this may result in the first few builds being less-optimized whilst the cache rebuilds.
