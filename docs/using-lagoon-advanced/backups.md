# Backups

Lagoon makes use of the [k8up operator](https://github.com/vshn/k8up) to provide backup functionality for both database data as well as containers' persistent storage volumes. This operator utilizes [Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) to catalog these backups, which is typically connected to an AWS S3 bucket to provide secure, off-site storage for the generated backups.

## Production Environments

Backups of databases and containers' persistent storage volumes happens nightly within production environments. Production environment backups will be held according to the following schedule by default:

* Daily: 7
* Weekly: 6
* Monthly: 1
* Hourly: 0

If a different retention period for production backups is required, this can be specified at a project level via setting the "Backup Retention" variables in the project's [.lagoon.yml](https://github.com/uselagoon/lagoon/tree/0f3527412262bf7cadf909019fca52726ed1a7c4/docs/using-lagoon-advanced/lagoon_yml.md) file.

### Retrieving Backups

Backups stored in Restic will be tracked within Lagoon, and can be recovered via the "Backup" tab for each environment in the Lagoon UI.

## Development Environments

Backups of development environments are attempted nightly and are strictly a best effort service.
